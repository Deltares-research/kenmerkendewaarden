    """
    Computing HAT and LAT from measurement timeseries, highest respectively lowest
    astronomical tides. This method derives the SA and SM components from 19 years of
    measurements (at once) and the other components from the most recent 4 years of
    measurements (per year, then vector averaged). The mean is overwitten with the
    slotgemiddelde, derived from the entire timerseries. The resulting component set is
    used to make a prediction of 19 years per year. The min and max from the resulting
    prediction timeseries are the LAT and HAT values.
    
    The slowly varying SA and SM can only be derived from long timeseries covering an
    entire nodal cycle. These components are sensitive to timeseries length, so it is
    important to supply a sufficiently long timeseries. The other components are varying
    more quickly and for those only the last four years are used to represent the tidal
    dynamics at the end of the period instead of the average over the last 19 years.
    This also goes for the average, which is overwritten by the slotgemiddelde
    corresponding to the end of the period. This results in LAT/HAT values that are
    representative for the end of the supplied period.
    
    Several alternative methods were considered, details are available in 
    https://github.com/Deltares-research/kenmerkendewaarden/issues/73
