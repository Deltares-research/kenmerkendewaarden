    """
    Compute the yearly means of the extremes (high and low waters) for spring tide and neap tide.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df_ext : pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame with extremes (highs and lows, no aggers). The last 10 years of this
        timeseries are used to compute the havengetallen.
    min_coverage : float, optional
        The minimal required coverage (between 0 to 1) of the df_ext timeseries to
        consider the statistics to be valid. It is the factor between the actual amount
        and the expected amount of high waters in the series. Note that the expected
        amount is not an exact extimate, so min_coverage=1 will probably result in nans
        even though all extremes are present. The default is None.
    moonculm_offset : int, optional
        Offset between moonculmination and extremes. Passed on to
        `calc_HWLW_moonculm_combi`. The default is 4, which corresponds to a 2-day
        offset, which is applicable to the Dutch coast. The default is 4.


    Returns
    -------
    dict_hwlw_springneap : dict
        Dictionary with Dataframes with yearly means of high and low waters for spring and neap tide.
